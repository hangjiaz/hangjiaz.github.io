<h3 class="archive__subtitle"> Welcome to My Website </h3>

I am a PhD student at the University of Zurich, specializing in cancer genomics. My research focuses on developing algorithms to optimize the identification of copy number variations (CNVs) from large-scale cancer genomic profiling datasets. In addition, I engage in quantitative data analysis to derive meaningful insights from these complex datasets.
<br><br>
Beyond my research, I am passionate about creating software that makes advanced methods and resources more accessible to the broader scientific community. I believe that sharing tools and knowledge is key to advancing research.
