excerpt: an algorithm for rapid and accurate annotation of tumor SCNA profiles
---

It is an algorithm designed for rapid and accurate annotation of CNA segments, with the aim of enhancing the interpretation of tumor SCNA profiles.

Leveraging density-based clustering and exploiting the lengthâ€“amplitude relationships of SCNA, labelSeg proficiently identifies distinct relative copy number states from individual segment profiles. Its compatibility with most CNA measurement platforms makes it suitable for large-scale integrative data analysis.
