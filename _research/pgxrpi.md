excerpt: Aim to provide a seamless way for retrieving genomic data from Progenetix databaseâ€”an open resource dedicated to curated oncogenomic profiles
---

It is an open-source R/Bioconductor package that provides an R interface to the [Progenetix](https://progenetix.org/) Beacon v2 REST API, facilitating efficient data querying. In addition to querying capabilities, pgxRpi includes functions for data visualization and analysis. By leveraging the [Beacon v2 standard](https://docs.genomebeacons.org/), pgxRpi extends its utility to querying multiple Beacon v2 REST APIs from various resources, thereby broadening its applicability.
